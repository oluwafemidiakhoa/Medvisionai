- **Disease Specific Analysis**: 92% probability of bacterial pneumonia based on consolidation pattern.
- **Smart Recommendations**:
  1. Consider empiric antibiotic therapy for community-acquired pneumonia
  2. Obtain blood cultures if not already done
  3. Consider supplemental oxygen therapy based on oxygen saturation
  4. Follow-up imaging in 4-6 weeks to confirm resolution

### Outcome Impact
- Reduced time to diagnosis by 65% compared to traditional workflow
- Standardized structured reporting improved communication with clinical team
- UMLS integration provided automatic coding for billing and records

## Case Study 2: COVID-19 Screening

### Clinical Scenario
- **Patient Profile**: 42-year-old female with fever and cough for 5 days
- **Image Type**: Chest X-ray
- **Clinical Question**: Evaluate for COVID-19 pneumonia

### RadVision AI Analysis
- **Initial Analysis**: Bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities predominantly in lower lung zones, pattern consistent with viral pneumonia.
- **Disease Specific Analysis**: Features highly suggestive of COVID-19 (91% confidence). Recommends correlation with PCR testing.
- **UMLS Concepts**: Automatically mapped to relevant concepts including "viral pneumonia" and "ground-glass opacity"
- **Smart Recommendations**:
  1. Confirm diagnosis with RT-PCR testing
  2. Monitor oxygen saturation levels
  3. Consider laboratory evaluation for inflammatory markers
  4. Implement appropriate isolation protocols

### Outcome Impact
- Facilitated rapid triage during high patient volume
- Standardized reporting reduced variability in interpretation
- PDF reports with embedded images improved remote consultation efficiency

## Case Study 3: Fracture Analysis

### Clinical Scenario
- **Patient Profile**: 72-year-old female with wrist pain after fall
- **Image Type**: Wrist X-ray (AP and Lateral views)
- **Clinical Question**: Evaluate for fracture

### RadVision AI Analysis
- **Initial Analysis**: Distal radius fracture identified with mild dorsal angulation. No additional carpal bone fractures identified.
- **ROI Analysis**: Focused measurement of fracture displacement (2.3mm) and angulation (18 degrees)
- **Smart Recommendations**:
  1. Consider closed reduction and casting
  2. Orthopedic consultation recommended
  3. Post-reduction imaging to confirm alignment
  4. Calcium and Vitamin D supplementation for osteoporosis management

### Outcome Impact
- Quantitative measurements improved treatment planning
- Standardized report template reduced documentation time by 40%
- UMLS coding improved search capabilities in clinical record system

## Case Study 4: Brain Tumor Assessment

### Clinical Scenario
- **Patient Profile**: 62-year-old male with new-onset headaches and vision changes
- **Image Type**: Brain MRI (T1 with contrast)
- **Clinical Question**: Evaluate for intracranial pathology

### RadVision AI Analysis
- **Initial Analysis**: 3.2cm enhancing mass in the right parietal lobe with surrounding edema and mass effect. Features most consistent with high-grade glioma.
- **Q&A Interaction**:
  * Q: "Is there midline shift?"
  * A: "Yes, there is 5mm of right-to-left midline shift due to mass effect."
  * Q: "Is there hydrocephalus?"
  * A: "No, the ventricular system appears normal in size without evidence of hydrocephalus."
- **Smart Recommendations**:
  1. Neurosurgical consultation recommended
  2. Consider dexamethasone for peritumoral edema
  3. Advanced imaging (MR spectroscopy, perfusion) may help characterize tumor
  4. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion recommended

### Outcome Impact
- Interactive Q&A feature allowed for detailed assessment without repeated image review
- PDF reports with integrated medical codes streamlined multidisciplinary communication
- ROI selection enabled precise tumor measurements for surgical planning

## Case Study 5: Tuberculosis Screening

### Clinical Scenario
- **Patient Profile**: 35-year-old immigrant from high-TB-prevalence region with chronic cough
- **Image Type**: Chest X-ray
- **Clinical Question**: Screen for tuberculosis

### RadVision AI Analysis
- **Initial Analysis**: Apical cavitary lesions in right upper lobe with surrounding nodular opacities. Findings highly suggestive of active pulmonary tuberculosis.
- **Disease Specific Analysis**: 89% probability of active TB based on radiographic pattern.
- **Confidence Analysis**: High confidence in TB diagnosis (level 4/5) with explanation of characteristic imaging features.
- **Smart Recommendations**:
  1. Obtain sputum samples for AFB smear and culture
  2. Respiratory isolation recommended
  3. Notify public health department
  4. Screen close contacts

### Outcome Impact
- Early detection triggered appropriate isolation procedures
- Standardized reporting improved public health notification process
- Automatic UMLS concept mapping facilitated epidemiological tracking
