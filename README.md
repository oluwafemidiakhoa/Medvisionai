Disclaimer: For research and educational use only. Always verify AI outputs with qualified clinical experts.

Features

Multi-Format Image Processing: Automatic support for DICOM metadata, window/level adjustment, and common image formats.

Drawable ROI Canvas: Focus AI analysis on user-selected regions of interest.

Initial Analysis: Automated, structured interpretation of image findings.

Contextual Q&A: Ask follow-up questions with full conversation history.

Condition-Focused Evaluation: Disease-specific analyses (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis).

AI Confidence Estimation: Numerical and qualitative confidence scoring.

Translation Module: Detect and translate AI text outputs while preserving formatting.

PDF Report Generation: Downloadable reports with embedded images, analyses, UMLS mappings, and medical codes.

UMLS Lookup & Auto-Enrichment: Standardized terminology support and interactive concept exploration.

Installation

Clone the repository



git clone https://github.com/yourusername/radvision-ai-advanced.git
cd radvision-ai-advanced

2. **(Optional) Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

Install dependencies



pip install -r requirements.txt


Ensure these core packages are installed:
- streamlit >= 1.44.1
- Pillow
- pydicom
- deep-translator
- fpdf2
- requests
- spacy, scispacy (for advanced UMLS filtering)

## Configuration

Before running the app, set environment variables (or add them to `.env` / `secrets.toml`):

```dotenv
HF_API_TOKEN=<your Hugging Face token>
GEMINI_API_KEY=<your Google Gemini API key>
GEMINI_MODEL_OVERRIDE=<optional model override>

# UMLS Integration
UMLS_APIKEY=<your UMLS REST API key>
UMLS_HITS=5                # Number of concepts to fetch
UMLS_SOURCE_FILTER=SNOMEDCT_US,ICD10CM  # Comma-separated filter (optional)

HF_API_TOKEN: For Hugging Face VQA fallback.

GEMINI_API_KEY: For primary LLM vision calls.

UMLS_APIKEY: To enable standardized terminology mapping.

UMLS_HITS: Controls number of UMLS concepts per result.

UMLS_SOURCE_FILTER: Restrict to specific vocabularies.

Running the Application

Launch the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py

The application will open in your default browser.

Usage Guide

Upload an Image: DICOM (.dcm) or standard (JPG/PNG).

Adjust DICOM Window/Level: If applicable.

Draw ROI: Use the canvas to focus AI on a region.

AI Analysis: Use sidebar actions:
