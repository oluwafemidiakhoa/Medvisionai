### Production Design Rationale ###
# 1. Color System:
#    - Uses a Tailwind-inspired palette with high contrast suited for medical applications.
#    - Older color overrides (dangerColor and successColor) have been removed to eliminate deprecation warnings.
#    - Dark mode is optimized for radiology workflows.
#
# 2. Component Design:
#    - Custom component styles have been commented out due to deprecation.
#    - Basic theming keys (base, primaryColor, etc.) remain.
#
# 3. Security:
#    - XSRF protection is enabled.
#    - Upload size restrictions are enforced.
#
# 4. Performance:
#    - Minimal configuration to reduce overhead.
#    - Deprecated settings like magicEnabled and caching have been commented out.
#
# 5. Compliance:
#    - HIPAA-friendly design with usage statistics disabled.
#    - Secure server binding is ensured.
