### 1. Quality System Regulation (21 CFR Part 820)

- **Design Controls** (Subpart C)
  - Design and development planning
  - Design input requirements
  - Design output specifications
  - Design reviews
  - Design verification and validation
  - Design transfer processes
  - Design changes documentation
  - Design history file

- **Document Controls** (Subpart D)
  - Document approval and distribution
  - Document changes

- **Software Validation** (21 CFR 820.30(g))
  - Software requirements specification
  - Software design specification
  - Software verification protocols and results
  - Software validation protocols and results
  - Software hazard analysis

### 2. Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)

- Technical specifications
- Device limitations

### 7. AI/ML-Specific Requirements

- Algorithm description and specifications
- Training and test datasets documentation
- Model performance metrics
- Update procedures and change control
- Continuous learning protocols (if applicable)

## Current Status of RadVision AI

RadVision AI is currently **not FDA cleared or approved** and is labeled for research and educational use only. Significant additional development and documentation would be required before FDA submission, including:

1. Complete design history file
2. Full software validation documentation
3. Clinical performance data
4. Comprehensive risk management file
5. Proper labeling and instructions for use
